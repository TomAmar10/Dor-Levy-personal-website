    "header": "My Story",
    "paragraph1": "Nice to meet you, my name is Dor Levy, 26 years old, from Rishon Lezion. <br /> I am an active trader and investor for about 6 years, primarily earning my income from trading and investments. <br /> I am involved in the Israeli stock market, the American stock market, cryptocurrencies, and the NFT field. <br /> I trade in all trading ranges - short, medium, and long term. <br /> In addition, I manage investment communities with over 20,000 members on WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.",
    "smallHeader": "How did it all start?",
    "paragraph2": "During my military service, my father managed my investment portfolio, and every month I would check its status. <br /> After a while, I noticed that he wasn't managing it professionally, so I asked to take control of my own investment portfolio. <br /> I thought to myself, \"How hard could it be?\" but like most traders, I lost a lot of money. <br /> About two years after taking over the portfolio without success, I found a mentor who changed my thinking and taught me the secrets of trading and investing. <br /> After a challenging period, I managed to recover all the losses and consistently make profits. <br /> During that time, I was a member of a group for the Israeli stock market, and other traders were very impressed with my performance. <br /> After a few months, the group manager offered me a position in the management team. <br /> After half a year, he decided to remove me from the group without any reason or explanation, and at that moment, I set a goal for myself - to develop the investment field in the country. <br /> To this day, I have founded and managed around 15 free WhatsApp study groups for the stock market, along with a partner. Simultaneously, I have independently managed additional groups of investors on WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook. <br /> In early 2022, I founded and managed an NFT company called \"HYPERSLOTHS\" with 20 employees and raised investments totaling 1,600,000â‚ª. <br /> Furthermore, in the past six months, I have been giving private lessons in the stock market out of love for the field and a desire to help investors."
